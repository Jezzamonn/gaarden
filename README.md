Take a break. Come play in the gaarden.

gaarden is equal parts about interaction and observation. Entry for Ludum Dare 45: "Start with Nothing".

From Wikipedia: “4X is a genre of strategy-based video and board games in which players control an empire and eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate”.

gaarden is designed to be the opposite of that. In gaarden you have no empire, and to start with, there is no world. There is no win condition or ending. Just a blank canvas. But there’s life waiting to be discovered...
